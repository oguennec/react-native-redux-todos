The redux todos example ported to a react-native demo app
=================================================
This repo contains the React-Native source code to build a Todos Demo App using all the boilerplate code to hook React to a Redux store using React-Redux Connect which can be found in this [redux todos example] which is meant for the web.

The idea came to me after trying various ways to integrate a Redux store into React-Native and eventually watching [Dan Abramov video on react-redux].

I hope that it will be useful for React-Native developers.
